# Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classifier.py
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. You'll learn how to preprocess image data, build and train a neural network using TensorFlow or Keras, and evaluate its accuracy. It’s a great introduction to computer vision and deep learning.
